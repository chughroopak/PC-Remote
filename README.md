About The Project:-

    ‘Remote PC’ is a tool used to provide remote access to clients in a local network.
    It can assess the configurations of desktops and determine if they have received the proper updates 
    — a task that is helpful to ensure all desktops are operating properly and securely. 
    It also manages desktop icons, background image and media message on LAN.
    It controls the Desktops within the network and keep desktops clean and tidy. 
    It even allows to add own Media message (video, image or HTML) that can be displayed on the remote 
    Desktops within the network.
    
    Our proposed project is ‘Remote PC’ which provides the complete control on the remote desktop.
    When ever the administrator wants to operate the remote system this application provides the requested host 
    desktop to the administrator so that he/she can operate the remote system directly with the system desktop. 
    It also provides some of the features like Desktop Sharing, Messenging and File Sharing.
    
    Features:- 
        1.	Desktop Sharing
            Administrator can directly access the remote system by sharing the requested system desktop. Desktop
            Sharing is a server application that allows to share current session with a user on another machine,
            who can use a client to view or even control the desktop. Desktop Sharing lets users call a remote 
            computer to access its shared desktop and applications.With the Desktop sharing we can operate our 
            office computer from our home or viceversa.

        2.	Messaging
            Administrator can communicate with the remote systems that are connected With in the local network 
            administrator can communicate publicly or privately.

        3.	File Sharing
            Administrator and remote systems that are connected with in the local network can share files using
            this application.
